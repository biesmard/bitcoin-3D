The oldest outputs are the most reliable, as the longer it's been since
they were received, the more blocks would need to be modified to double
spend them. However, after just a few blocks, a point of rapidly
diminishing returns is reached. The [original Bitcoin paper][bitcoinpdf]
predicts the chance of an attacker being able to modify old blocks,
assuming the attacker has 30% of the total network hashing power:

| Blocks | Chance of successful modification |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| 5      | 17.73523%                        |
| 10     | 4.16605%                         |
| 15     | 1.01008%                         |
| 20     | 0.24804%                         |
| 25     | 0.06132%                         |
| 30     | 0.01522%                         |
| 35     | 0.00379%                         |
| 40     | 0.00095%                         |
| 45     | 0.00024%                         |
| 50     | 0.00006%                         |

FIFO does have a small advantage when it comes to transaction fees, as
older outputs may be eligible for inclusion in the 50,000 bytes set
aside for no-fee-required high-priority transactions by miners running the default Bitcoin Core
codebase.  However, with transaction fees being so low, this is not a
significant advantage.

The only practical use of FIFO is by receivers who spend all or most
of their income within a few blocks, and who want to reduce the
chance of their payments becoming accidentally invalid. For example,
a receiver who holds each payment for six confirmations, and then
spends 100% of verified payments to vendors and a savings account on
a bi-hourly schedule.

### Rebilling Recurring Payments
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% autocrossref %}

Automated recurring payments are not possible with decentralized Bitcoin
wallets. Even if a wallet supported automatically sending non-reversible
payments on a regular schedule, the user would still need to start the
program at the appointed time, or leave it running all the time
unprotected by encryption.

This means automated recurring Bitcoin payments can only be made from a
centralized server which handles satoshis on behalf of its spenders. In
practice, receivers who want to set prices in fiat terms must also let
the same centralized server choose the appropriate exchange rate.

Non-automated rebilling can be managed by the same mechanism used before
credit-card recurring payments became common: contact the spender and
ask them to pay again---for example, by sending them a PaymentRequest
`bitcoin:` URI in an HTML email.

In the future, extensions to the payment protocol and new wallet
features may allow some wallet programs to manage a list of recurring
transactions. The spender will still need to start the program on a
regular basis and authorize payment---but it should be easier and more
secure for the spender than clicking an emailed invoice, increasing the
chance receivers get paid on time.
